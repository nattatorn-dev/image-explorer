# image-explorer

This library is a compatibility layer around
[@oblador/react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)
to work with the Expo asset system. If you're using React Native
without Expo, you have no need for this library -- carry on! (or
maybe [check out Expo](https://expo.io/).
